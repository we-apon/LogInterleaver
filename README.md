# LogInterleaver
Simple console (net.core 3.1) application for merging text logs, storred in many separate files, by timestamps.

You can customize DateTime format and Regex for extracting timestamps, specify start and end times of resulting logs, and also filter logs by full-text matching or Regex.

Currently only ouput to file supported,
and currently Help not available.
I'm too lazy - see Options.cs for usage, It's pretty simple
